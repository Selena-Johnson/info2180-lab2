            I love studying computer science because it allows me to create digital solutions that can impact people's lives tremendously. The field is continuously growing, which keeps me engaged and excited to learn new technologies, tools and programming languages.
            Additionally, computer science offers a wide range of career opportunities, from software development to database administration, making it a versatile, flexible and rewarding discipline. 
            Lastly, it gives me the oppurtunity to work from and collaborate with others anywhere in the world. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            The tools I use regularly as a computer science student include programming languages such as Python and Java. 
            I also use Github and VS Studio Code. These tools make being a computer science student fun and exciting.

            College life comes with its own set of challenges ranging from late-night study sessions, early morning lectures to never-ending assignments and projects .
            With a simple cup of coffee, a student can go from feeling slugglish and drained to being alert, focused and ready to tackle the day ahead
          </p>
          <p>
            Coffee is not just a beverage; it brings people together, it comforts and it energizes. 
            <b>Please note:</b> Not everyone should consume it. So do your research and a consult a doctor before you decide to bring coffee into your life.
